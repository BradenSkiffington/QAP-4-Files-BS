'''
Create a second Python program that will allow the
user to enter the total amount of sales for each month
from January to December –note that if it not the end
of the year some of the monthly values may be 0.
Place the values in a list representing the y-axis.  V
alues for the x-axis will be the months in the form “Jan”,
“Feb”, “Mar”, ...  Use Matplotlib to create a graph of the total
sales($) against the months using the two lists created.
'''

# Import Libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Lists
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]

# User input for sales
sales = []
for i in range(12):
    sales.append(float(input(f"Enter the total sales for {months[i]}: ")))

# Graph the sales
plt.plot(months, sales)

# Give titles for the graph
plt.title("Total Sales by Month")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Sales ($)")

# Show the graph
plt.show()
